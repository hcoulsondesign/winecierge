SEO and Analytics:

The underlying principle throughout my research was that increasing organic traffic
through SEO is preferable to any paid effort to generate website traffic. Therefore, although
it adds another layer of consideration in the planning, implementation, launch, and upkeep
of a website, it is worth the website owner's effort.

Since the internet is an ever-changing environment driven by current trends in human
behavior, search engines are constantly changing and updating to follow these trends.
For example, an increasing trend over the last decade toward searching and accessing
websites from a mobile device followed by a global pandemic that has elevated the importance
of remote services has greatly impacted how search engines evaluate websites in order to
meet users' needs in 2021. Consequently, well-implemented SEO requires constant upkeep
to remain optimized for these changes.

Many companies follow a cyclical system of goal identification --> research --> implemention -->
testing and evaluation. The last step serves as a feedback mechanism and indication of
how successful the current SEO is, which in return can lead to another iteration of
the cycle starting with identification of new goals. Analytics can be employed in the
research  and evaluation phases of SEO development in order to help identify natural
traffic patterns within a webpage and key features, words, or topics that visitors deem
most important or useful.


SEO Implementation:

As is the case with many large projects, adequate research and planning in the early
phases of development helps streamline implementation of goals throughout the process.
Therefore, just as identifying a target audience, purpose, and framework for a website is
important for an organized development process, early research and planning for SEO
implementation is invaluable to ensuring the site's success in attracting organic traffic.

To successfully implement SEO, I would:
1) Take SEO goals into consideration in planning information layout within the website so
that each page's semantic elements created a natural hierarchy for crawlers to identify and
follow. Additionally, implementation of best web programming practices for accessibility,
etc ensures that search engines won't downgrade a site's value because of sloppy short-cutting.
2) Identify clear goals of SEO and evaluate them against the current state of SEO.
3) Perform keyword research on related sites and topics, and identify keywords that help
crawlers accurately and concisely identify a page's content.
4) Implement the improvements identified in steps 2 and 3, e.g. update page descriptions and
embed keywords in the metadata for each page.
5) Build awareness through social media tags and links
6) Evaluate the effect the changes have had repeat to process to continue optimization.
